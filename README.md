## 📋 Issues Overview

This document details the steps taken to fix a corrupted Unreal Engine project, addressing critical issues ranging from project opening failures to in-game mechanics and performance optimization.

---

## 🚨 1. Project Opening Failure

### ❌ **Problem**
The Unreal Engine project was entirely corrupted and failed to open, despite standard troubleshooting attempts like file verification.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Direct .uproject File Opening
- Directly opened the `.uproject` file to bypass Unreal Engine Launcher
- Revealed more specific error messages related to project integrity

#### 🔹 Plugin Removal
- Identified and removed references to undesirable/corrupted plugin from project configuration
- Edited the `.uproject` file directly to remove plugin's entry

#### 🔹 Plugin Status Adjustment
- Set the "deadplugin" to `False` within the project's configuration
- Prevented engine from attempting to load faulty plugin that was blocking project launch

---

## 🎮 2. Missing Player, Game Logic, and Music

### ❌ **Problem**
After successfully opening the project, clicking "Play" resulted in an empty scene. Character did not spawn or move, indicating breakdown in startup logic or player setup. Background music was missing.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Game Mode Configuration
- Added/re-assigned appropriate Game Mode in World Settings
- Defined game rules: player pawn class, player controller, HUD, and game state

#### 🔹 Music Restoration
- **Sound Cue Implementation** : Encapsulated music audio files within Sound Cue for advanced control
- **"Play Sound at Location" Node** : Relocated misplaced node (found hidden at bottom of Blueprint graph)

---

## 💎 3. White Crystal Outline Mystery

### ❌ **Problem**
All crystals displayed an unintended white outline, deviating from original visual design and suggesting a rendering or material issue.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Decal Size Adjustment in BP_Item_Crystal
- Navigated to `BP_Item_Crystal` Blueprint
- Reduced `Decal Size` property to `0, 0, 0`
- Effectively disabled unwanted decal rendering without removing component entirely

---

## 🔊 4. Broken Crystal Music Interaction

### ❌ **Problem**
Crystals were supposed to play sounds upon interaction, but they were silent, lacking auditory feedback.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Sound Trigger Restoration
- **Sound Cue Implementation** : Put interaction sounds into Sound Cue system
- **"Play Sound at Location" Node** : Correctly positioned and connected within crystal's interaction logic

---

## 🤝 5. Broken Interaction with Crystals

### ❌ **Problem**
Interacting with crystals was non-functional; pressing interaction buttons yielded no response from the game, suggesting a broken interaction system.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Blueprint Player (BP_FPSPlayer) Enhancements

##### ⚙️ **Enable "Start with Tick" on Component**
- Activated property on main component of BP_FPSPlayer
- Ensured Event Tick begins immediately for continuous interaction checks

##### 🔄 **Invert Actor Has Tag Branch**
- Corrected branch logic in BP_FPSPlayer Event Tick
- Ensured raycast correctly identifies interactive objects based on tags

##### 🎯 **Fix Single Crystal Interaction**
- **Reset Holding Object** : Added Set node in Force Ungrab Function to mark object release
- **Re-invert Actor Has Tag Branch** : Refined previous inversion for consistent behavior
- **Add "Item" Tag to BP_Crystal** : Essential for raycast identification of interactive objects
- **Hide Info Text Conditional** : Added condition to hide info text when interaction unsuccessful
- **Reset Hit Actor** : Added Set node in LineTraceNotOverlapping to clear previous trace results

---

## 🧩 6. Non-Functional Puzzle

### ❌ **Problem**
The crystal color puzzle, intended to trigger an event upon entering the correct red, blue, green combination, was not working. It functioned merely as lights without any logical outcome.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Sequence Trigger Variable Creation
- Created new variable to trigger puzzle sequence
- Acts as gate/flag controlling when puzzle event should activate

#### 🔹 Logic Correction
- Fixed underlying puzzle logic for proper sequence detection
- Ensured correct input sequence (red, blue, green) validation by Blueprint system

#### 🔹 Sequence Implementation
- Implemented mechanism to launch associated sequence upon correct combination
- Set trigger variable correctly for sequence activation

#### 🔹 "Keep State When Finished" Configuration
- Set property to `True` on sequence
- Ensured final state persists after completion rather than reverting to initial state

---

## ⚡ 7. Optimization Purgatory

### ❌ **Problem**
The project suffered from severe performance issues, consistently yielding 10-20 FPS in a nearly empty scene, indicating resource-intensive elements were active.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Lightmap Building
- Rebuilt project's lighting system
- Pre-calculated static lighting to improve runtime performance
- Eliminated real-time lighting recalculation overhead

#### 🔹 Event Tick Disconnection
- **GM_Level** : Disconnected Event Tick nodes in Game Mode for Level
- **Level Blueprint** : Disconnected Event Tick nodes to eliminate per-frame resource drain
- Disabled unnecessary per-frame calculations that were degrading performance

---

## 🚀 8. Final Build Preparation

### ❌ **Problem**
To ensure a clean and functional build of the project, a final check for problematic elements was required.

### ✅ **Solution**

#### 🔹 Remove Bad Plugin Line from DefaultEngine.ini
- Removed specific line referencing problematic plugin from configuration file
- Prevented plugin packaging with final build to avoid crashes or instability in shipping product
